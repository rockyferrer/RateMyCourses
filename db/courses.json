Strategic use of technology in all sorts of businesses makes the difference between success and failure for these firms. Wealth creation is a real option for many and the business atmosphere is ready for you! Increasingly, people are seeing the advantages of doing their own thing, in their own way, in their own time. Entrepreneurs can control their own lives, structure their own progress and be accountable for their own success - they can fail, but they can not be fired! After all, engineers are the most capable people to be in the forefront of this drive to the business life of the next century.

There will be a certificate awarded upon the successful completion of both courses attesting to the fact that the student has passed this Entrepreneurial Course Series at the University of Toronto. The course is based on real life issues, not theoretical developments or untried options. Topics covered include: Who is an entrepreneur; Canadian business environment; Acquisitions; Different business types (retail, wholesale, manufacturing, and services); Franchising; Human resources, Leadership, Business law; and many others.

You will grade their papers, hold office hours, and meet with the relevant professor as needed. You will be paid for 100 hours of work each semester, for a total of 200 hours, at the current hourly wage for CUPE Unit 1. The second component of the course is a seminar component that meets once per week for 3 hours. Roughly 75% of the seminar will be devoted to more in-depth study of the topics taken up in the PHL105Y. You will write a seminar paper on one of these topics under the supervision of a UTM Philosophy faculty member working in the relevant area. You will also give an oral presentation on your topic to the seminar members. The remaining 25% of the seminar will focus on the methods and challenges of teaching philosophy, benchmark grading, and grading issues generally.
